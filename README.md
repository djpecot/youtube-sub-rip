# youtube-sub-rip
MV3 Chrome Extension for ripping hard-coded/baked-in/non-CC subtitles from Youtube videos (Watch a lot of videos in Chinese? you'll love this).

## Onboarding

### JS/Web
We will use `yarn` as our package manager for JS related stuff. Install for [whichever system](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable):

After installing yarn and cloning this repo, at the top level run `yarn install` to pull all the modules we need.


## ü•çGoals
- Create an [MV3 Chrome Extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/)
- Scan images in YouTube videos for subtitles (see 1st image above) [(Example video without CC but has "baked" subs or whatever the term is)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j92Wv3l89n8)
- Extract subtitles and render as CC (basically want to force-add subtitles) (see 2nd image)
- ! If necessary, figure out server-side CV solution that won't break our wallets
- HAVE FUN WHILE DOING IT!
- BONUS: Catch "pop-up" subtitles

## üìãü§ØPlanning + Brainstorming
### UI
- Configuration-Settings:
  - toggle on/off
  - ? adjustments based on model
  - ? Add a model

### ü§ñCV Architecture
**Paige**, could use your input here. Core questions we can think about before running too far ahead would be:
- Can we succesfully run a model in some dev environment (Python notebook, local JS etc.) that extracts the subtitles into txt/json format?
- Are there any JS models that can do this job?
- I think since this is a web environment, ideally we'd like to do client-side for speed's/price's sake if at all possible. I believe [Chrome Web Store is limited to 2GB size](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17817631/is-there-a-size-limit-on-a-crx-for-a-chrome-app-thats-installed-manually#:~:text=Yes%2C%20There%20is%20a%20limit,this%20answer%20is%20being%20posted.) I think aiming initially for a size of 500MB would be a reasonable trade-off between speed to download and not too "heavy" of an extension, but let me know what you find!
- If we can't run a JS model / client-side we can look into setting up our own cloud instance on GCP or something similar that won't be uber expensive. We could also even just create a "shell" extension and have our users download the model to their computer after installing

## Decisions
None so far üòÖ
